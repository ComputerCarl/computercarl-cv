                                Almost since web development became a thing, JavaScript (JS) has been in the background wiring web apps to make stuff happen.
                                HTML provides the structure, CSS provides styling, and JS provides not only the (advanced) interactivity â€“ but with the advent of Node (server-side JS), now JS can power the entire stack.
